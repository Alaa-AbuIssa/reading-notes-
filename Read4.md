JavaScript is a scripting or programming and interpreted language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.  you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML & CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning area 
so we can said that JavaScript is a language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else..

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
If you want to write a script, you need first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it
Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
As we said you have to define the things that you want to achieve. Then you have to design a script .
Then each step has to be written in programming language. 


About my reading of Expressions and operators:
An Expression evaluates into results in a single value and there are two types of expressions:
- Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.
- Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
