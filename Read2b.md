About my reading i see that the Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes  .
and its saperate to :
1- Local Version Control
2-Centralized Version Control
3-Distributed Version Control


About the "Git":
ummm--  it's a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. It includes inherent Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools. Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.

You can install Git in three ways :1-Install as a package
2-Install via another installer
3-Download and compile the source code.
After making sure Git has been installed, you should perform some customization steps, which should only need to be completed once on any machine.
