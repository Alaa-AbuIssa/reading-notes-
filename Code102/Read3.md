About my reading 

Structured programming (SP) is a technique devised to improve the reliability and clarity of programs. In SP, control of program flow is restricted to three structures, sequence, IF THEN ELSE, and DO WHILE, or to a structure derivable from a combination of the basic three. Thus, a structured program does not need to use GO TOs or branches (unless it is written in a language that does not have statement forms corresponding to the SP structures, in which case, GO TOs may be used to simulate the structures). The result is a program built of modules that are highly independent of each other. In turn, this allows a programmer to be more confident that the code contains fewer logic errors and will be easier to debug and change in the future. However, SP may be less efficient than an unstructured counterpart. Another disadvantage is the relative difficulty of using SP with a language that doesn’t support it, although this situation is changing as languages are updated.


About HTML versions 
 We are mostly aware of websites. A website is simply a collection of web pages for creating any web page we require HTML. An HTML is the element that is responsible for making any web page. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is basic markup language that is used to make any web pages which further comprises to form websites. HTML has evolved so much from the initial stage when it was formed.
There is lots of version of HTML which is being developed. From an initial version of 1.0 to the latest version of 5.2, HTML has developed a lot. W3C has also maintained standards so that all browsers could have a common standard to follow. HTML5 has developed a lot with new tags and support of form elements.


HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

	<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
	<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
	<section> - Defines a section in a document
	<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
	<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
	<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
	<details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
	<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element
      



About the process and designing 

for me, steps to design a website require 7 steps:
•	Goal identification: Where I work with the client to determine what goals the new website needs to fulfill. I.e., what its purpose is.
•	Scope definition: Once we know the site's goals, we can define the scope of the project. I.e., what web pages and features the site requires to fulfill the goal, and the timeline for building those out.
•	Sitemap and wireframe creation: With the scope well-defined, we can start digging into the sitemap, defining how the content and features we defined in scope definition will interrelate.
•	Content creation: Now that we have a bigger picture of the site in mind, we can start creating content for the individual pages, always keeping search engine optimization (SEO) in mind to help keep pages focused on a single topic. It's vital that you have real content to work with for our next stage:
•	Visual elements: With the site architecture and some content in place, we can start working on the visual brand. Depending on the client, this may already be well-defined, but you might also be defining the visual style from the ground up. Tools like style tiles, mood boards, and element collages can help with this process.
•	Testing: By now, you've got all your pages and defined how they display to the site visitor, so it's time to make sure it all works. Combine manual browsing of the site on a variety of devices with automated site crawlers to identify everything from user experience issues to simple broken links.
•	Launch: Once everything's working beautifully, it's time to plan and execute your site launch! This should include planning both launch timing and communication strategies — i.e., when will you launch and how will you let the world know? After that, it's time to break out the bubbly.
