A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

 

Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”

 

The Linux command line is a text interface to your computer.
 Often referred to as the shell, terminal, console, prompt or various other names, 
it can give the appearance of being complex and confusing to use.
 Yet the ability to copy and paste commands from a website,
 combined with the power and flexibility the command line offers,
 means that using it may be essential when trying to follow instructions online, including many on this very website!

 It is the location in the filesystem where you have full dominion.
