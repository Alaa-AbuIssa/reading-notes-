# Hello everyone it's Alaa Abu Issa talking here

ummmm.. Achtully I'm a **Civil Engineer** but as you know the bad situation in my field especially in these days ,
So to be honest i decided to shift may career to be inshalla a profitional ***Full Stak Developer*** in this grateful journey and an amazing instructors team.


## today we will talk about "Mindset & growth mindset" 
### first of all we have to know what's the mindest meaning , which is refers to whether you believe qualities such as intelligence and talent are fixed or changeable traits.
There are two different types of **mindset:

People with a ***fixed mindset*** believe that these qualities are inborn, fixed, and unchangeable.
Those with a ***growth mindset***, on the other hand, believe that these abilities can be developed and strengthened by way of commitment and hard work.

**if we fouce on Growth Mindest definition we get that is _when students understand that their abilities can be developed_**
and from my side there is a many ways to keep my mindset growth but if you asked me what's the mostly recommended ways i will answer :
### 1-View challenges as opportunities.
### 2- Follow the research on brain plasticity.
### 3- Replace the word *failing* with the word *learning.
